Description:
        Contextual Help provides a framework for adding help articles to controller/action combinations.
        Provides helpers to serve up relevant help at controller/action/help.
        

Example:
    ./script/generate contextual_help foo
    
    foo doesn't matter at this time.

    This will add:
      contextual_help to app/controllers/application_controller.rb

      The following routes to config/routes.rb:
          map.connect ':controller/help.:format', :action => :help
          map.connect ':controller/:rest/help.:format', :action => :help
          map.resources :help_locations
          map.resources :help_articles
      
      db/migrate/..._create_contextual_help_tables.rb

    This will create:
         app/views/help_articles/_form.html.erb
         app/views/help_articles/edit.html.erb
         app/views/help_articles/index.html.erb
         app/views/help_articles/new.html.erb
         app/views/help_articles/show.html.erb

         app/views/help_locations/edit.html.erb
         app/views/help_locations/index.html.erb
         app/views/help_locations/new.html.erb
         app/views/help_locations/show.html.erb

         app/views/shared/help.html.erb # view for rendering help articles

General Usage:
        rake db:migrate
        
        Go to /help_locations/new and click generate.
        This will populate/update the locations based on the routes currently in your application.
        
        Add help articles (help_articles/new), selected which locations they apply to.

        Add contextual_help_link to pages you want help linked from. 
        It will produce links of the format current/url/help
        /help will provide the help articles that match that controller action combination

        contextual_help_link has the following options:
          :alway_link, defaults false
             show help link if there is help available or not
          :name, defaults 'Help'
             display name for link
          :page_tip, defaults false
             adds page_tip flag, which pulls only help marked page_tip
        
        The /help action returns a list of articles matching the controller/action it gets.
            foo/help would match foo/index
            foo/new/help would match foo/new
        It will serve html, xml, or json. The page_tip flag allows limiting it to just things marked page_tip
